    <h3 class="subtitle">Recipe for Loin with Champignon with Cream and Green Sauce</h3>
    <div class="description">
      <p>
        A simple and delicious recipe to enjoy tender meat with all the <br />
        flavor that the cream sauce gives to greeno with mushrooms. <br />
        On this occasion we used Loin
        <i>(or Sirloin of Veal, as it is known in Spain)</i> <br />
        but you can also use other cuts such as Tail of Cuadril, <br />
        steak eye <i>(Argentine court)</i> or even <br />
        chicken or Fish, they are also very delicious.
      </p>

    <h3 class="subtitle">Preparation time</h3>
    <div class="preparation-time">
      <ol>
        <li>Cut the mushrooms into quarters and reserve them in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Peel and cut the onions into “strips”. Reserve in another bowl.</li>
        <li>
          Take the green onion, cut the white part and reserve along with the
          onion.
        </li>
        <li>Then cut the green part and reserve in a separate bowl.</li>
        <li>
          The next thing is to clean and cut the loin. First, <br />
          remove any excess fat that can be seen with the naked eye.
        </li>
        <li>
          With a sharp knife cut flush, avoiding removing pieces <br />
          of meat or creating imperfections on the surface of the loin.
        </li>
        <li>Then cut the loin into medallions of at least 3cm thickness.</li>
        <li>
          Once the medallions are cut, probably on a “tip” of meat. <br />
          Instead of cutting this piece in the shape of a medallion, <br />
          we are going to cut it differently. Make a cut in the center, <br />
          without cutting it completely. Then fold to form a medallion <br />
          with the two parts. Just crush it with your hand and it's ready.
        </li>
      </ol>

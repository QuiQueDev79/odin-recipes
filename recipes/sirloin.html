    <img src="lomo-champignon.jpg" alt="" height="400" width="300" />
    <p>
      A simple and delicious recipe to enjoy tender meat with all the <br />
      flavor that the cream sauce gives to greeno with mushrooms. <br />
      On this occasion we used Loin (or Sirloin of Veal, as it is known in
      Spain) <br />
      but you can also use other cuts such as Tail of Cuadril, Ojo de Bife or
      even <br />
      chicken or Fish, they are also very delicious.

    <h3>Recipe for Loin with Champignon with Cream and Green Sauce</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      A simple and delicious recipe to enjoy tender meat with all the <br />
      flavor that the cream sauce gives to greeno with mushrooms. <br />
      On this occasion we used Loin
      <i>(or Sirloin of Veal, as it is known in Spain)</i> <br />
      but you can also use other cuts such as Tail of Cuadril, <br />
      steak eye <i>(Argentine court)</i> or even <br />
      chicken or Fish, they are also very delicious.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>Beef Loin 850 Gr</li>
      <li>Champignon 200 Gr</li>
      <li>Onion 3 u. (medium)</li>
      <li>Green onion 3 u.</li>
      <li>Cream / Cream 200 Ml.</li>
      <li>White Wine 100 Ml.</li>
      <li>Butter / Butter 25 Gr.</li>
      <li>Olive Oil c/n</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>Step by step recipe</h3>
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>Cut the mushrooms into quarters and reserve them in a bowl.</li>
      <li>Peel and cut the onions into “strips”. Reserve in another bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Take the green onion, cut the white part and reserve along with the
        onion.
      </li>
      <li>Then cut the green part and reserve in a separate bowl.</li>
      <li>
        The next thing is to clean and cut the loin. First, <br />
        remove any excess fat that can be seen with the naked eye.
      </li>
      <li>
        With a sharp knife cut flush, avoiding removing pieces <br />
        of meat or creating imperfections on the surface of the loin.
      </li>
      <li>Then cut the loin into medallions of at least 3cm thickness.</li>
      <li>
        Once the medallions are cut, probably on a “tip” of meat. <br />
        Instead of cutting this piece in the shape of a medallion, <br />
        we are going to cut it differently. Make a cut in the center, <br />
        without cutting it completely. Then fold to form a medallion <br />
        with the two parts. Just crush it with your hand and it's ready.
      </li>
    </ol>

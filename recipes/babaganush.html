        The traditional Baba Ganoush recipe incorporates an uncommon <br />
        ingredient in our cuisine and it is “Tahini”. Tahini is a creamy <br />
        paste made from crushed sesame seeds. This is a very common <br />
        ingredient in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine, it is used <br />
        to prepare a wide variety of dishes, from sauces to dressings and <br />
        also desserts.
